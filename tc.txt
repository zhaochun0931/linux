Linux offers tools for managing and manipulating the transmission of packets. 

The Linux Traffic Control(TC) subsystem helps in policing, classifying, shaping, and scheduling network traffic. TC also mangles
the packet content during classification by using filters and actions. The TC subsystem achieves this by
using queuing disciplines (qdisc), a fundamental element of the TC architecture.

The scheduling mechanism arranges or rearranges the packets before they enter or exit different
queues. The most common scheduler is the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheduler. You can do the qdiscs
operations temporarily using the tc utility or permanently using NetworkManager.






tc qdisc show dev eth0
tc -s qdisc show dev eth0



# packet loss 10%
To simulate network latency using tc, you can use the netem (Network Emulator) queue discipline. netem allows you to introduce various network impairments such as delay, loss, duplication, and reordering.


tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 10%
tc qdisc del dev eth0 root








tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms
