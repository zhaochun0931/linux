mTLS (Mutual TLS) is a security protocol that enhances standard TLS (Transport Layer Security) by requiring both the client and server to authenticate each other. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:

What is mTLS?
Mutual TLS (mTLS) is an extension of TLS (which is used to secure communication between clients and servers) that adds an extra layer of authentication. In a typical TLS setup, the server presents a certificate to the client, and the client verifies the server's identity. In mTLS, both the client and the server authenticate each other using their respective certificates.





How mTLS Works

Server Authentication:
The server presents its certificate to the client.
The client verifies the server's certificate against trusted certificate authorities (CAs).

Client Authentication:
The client also presents its certificate to the server.
The server verifies the client's certificate against its list of trusted CAs.








Secure Communication:

Once both parties are authenticated, a secure, encrypted communication channel is established using TLS.
