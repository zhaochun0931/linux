CNAME stands for Canonical Name record. It’s a type of DNS record used to alias one domain name to another.



Useful when multiple domains need to resolve to the same host.

The CNAME points to a canonical (real) domain, which then resolves to an IP via its A or AAAA record.


  
  
2️⃣ Syntax

Example DNS record:

www.example.com.   IN   CNAME   example.com.


www.example.com → alias

example.com → canonical name (the real host)

When someone accesses www.example.com, DNS looks up example.com and returns its IP






DNS Lookup with CNAME

Suppose we have this setup:

www.example.com  → CNAME → example.com
example.com      → A     → 192.0.2.123

Step 1️⃣ Client requests www.example.com
Client
  |
  |--- DNS query: www.example.com ---> DNS Resolver



  
Step 2️⃣ DNS resolver finds CNAME
DNS Resolver
  |
  |--- sees: www.example.com is a CNAME to example.com
  |--- performs new query for example.com



  
Step 3️⃣ DNS resolver finds A record
DNS Resolver
  |
  |--- example.com has A record 192.0.2.123
  |
  |--- returns IP to Client




Step 4️⃣ Client connects to IP
Client
  |
  |--- Connects to 192.0.2.123 (example.com)
  |
  |--- Request succeeds
