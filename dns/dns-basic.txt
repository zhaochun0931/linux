Name resolution (as it relates to IP networking) is the process of mapping hostnames to IP addresses, and vice-versa, making it easier to identify resources on a network.

configure your system for name resolution using DNS and static hostname records

The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating (resolving) a service name to an IP address. 



Traditionally, the file /etc/resolv.conf was a static configuration file





systemd-resolved handles nameserver configuration, and it should be interacted with through the systemd-resolve command. Netplan configures systemd-resolved to generate a list of nameservers and domains to put in /etc/resolv.conf, which is a symlink:


# ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 Aug 10  2023 /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
#
/etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf








Static hostnames

Static hostnames are locally defined hostname-to-IP mappings located in the file /etc/hosts

Entries in the hosts file will have precedence over DNS by default.
