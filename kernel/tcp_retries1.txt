In Linux TCP, tcp_retries1 and tcp_retries2 control different phases of retransmission on an established TCP connection. Think of them as “early warning” vs “final death sentence.”









tcp_retries1 — early retransmission phase

net.ipv4.tcp_retries1


What it does

Defines how many retransmissions happen before TCP assumes something is wrong

After this threshold:

TCP reduces congestion window

May trigger route/path failure detection

Enters more conservative behavior

⚠️ Connection is NOT closed






tcp_retries2 — final abort threshold
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2

What it does

Maximum number of retransmissions before the socket is abandoned

When exceeded:

TCP closes the connection

Application sees:

ETIMEDOUT

ECONNRESET (in some cases)
