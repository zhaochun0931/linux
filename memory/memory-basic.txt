1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Page Basics

Page: smallest unit of memory management in Linux.

Typical page size:

  4 KB (most common)
  
  2 MB or 1 GB (huge pages / huge TLB)

All memory allocations are page-aligned internally.




Check page size in Linux:

getconf PAGE_SIZE



# getconf PAGE_SIZE

üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fundamental Concepts
üîπ Virtual Memory (VM)

Every process in Linux sees its own virtual address space, e.g. 4 GB on 32-bit or 128 TB on 64-bit systems.
This abstraction:

Simplifies programming (each process starts at address 0x0)

Provides isolation (processes can‚Äôt access each other‚Äôs memory)

Allows paging and swapping



üîπ Pages

The smallest unit of memory management.

Most x86_64 systems use 4 KB pages, though large pages (2 MB, 1 GB) exist.

Every virtual memory area (VMA) is mapped by page tables that connect:
