Most applications use the getaddrinfo() function of the glibc library to resolve DNS requests. By
default, glibc sends all DNS requests to the first DNS server specified in the /etc/resolv.conf file. If this
server does not reply, RHEL uses the next server in this file. NetworkManager enables you to influence
the order of DNS servers in etc/resolv.conf.
