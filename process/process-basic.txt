A Linux process is much more than just “a running program”. It has memory, file descriptors, threads, scheduling info, signals, namespaces, and more.




🔹 1. What is a Process?

An instance of a program in execution.

Identified by PID (Process ID).

Each process has:

    Code (text segment)
    
    Data (heap, stack, globals)
    
    Open files
    
    Execution context (registers, program counter)
    
    Kernel structures (task_struct in kernel space)




🔹 2. Process IDs

PID → unique ID for each process.

PPID → parent process ID.

TGID → thread group ID (main thread’s PID).

Check:

ps -o pid,ppid,comm
