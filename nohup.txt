nohup allows the launching of a process independently of a connection.



nohup command




nohup ignores the SIGHUP signal sent when a user logs out.





nohup your-command > output.log 2>&1 &



Breakdown:
nohup: Makes the command immune to hangups (e.g., when you log out).

your-command: The command you want to run.

>: Redirects stdout to output.log.

2>&1: Redirects stderr to where stdout is going (i.e., to output.log).

&: Runs the command in the background.
