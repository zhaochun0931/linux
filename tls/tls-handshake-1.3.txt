TLS 1.3 does not support RSA, nor other cipher suites and parameters that are vulnerable to attack. It also shortens the TLS handshake, making a TLS 1.3 handshake both faster and more secure.

The basic steps of a TLS 1.3 handshake are:

1. Client hello: The client sends a client hello message with the protocol version, the client random, and a list of cipher suites. 
Because support for insecure cipher suites has been removed from TLS 1.3, the number of possible cipher suites is vastly reduced. 
The client hello also includes the parameters that will be used for calculating the premaster secret. 
Essentially, the client is assuming that it knows the server’s preferred key exchange method (which, due to the simplified list of cipher suites, it probably does). 
This cuts down the overall length of the handshake — one of the important differences between TLS 1.3 handshakes and TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 handshakes.

2. Server generates master secret: At this point, the server has received the client random and the client's parameters and cipher suites. 
It already has the server random, since it can generate that on its own. Therefore, the server can create the master secret.

3. Server hello and "Finished": The server hello includes the server’s certificate, digital signature, server random, and chosen cipher suite. 
Because it already has the master secret, it also sends a "Finished" message.

4. Final steps and client "Finished": Client verifies signature and certificate, generates master secret, and sends "Finished" message.

5. Secure symmetric encryption achieved
