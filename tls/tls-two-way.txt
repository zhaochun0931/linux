In two-way SSL authentication, the client application verifies the identity of the server application, and then the server application verifies the identity of the client application. Both parties share their public certificates, and then validation is performed. Two-way SSL authentication works with a mutual handshake by exchanging the certificates. You can also authenticate through a username or Common Name injection.





Here are the steps required for a 2 way SSL handshake process:

First, the client sends supported cipher suites and compatible SSL/TLS version to initiate the connection. This is called the “client hello” message.

In return, the web server checks the cipher suites and SSL/TLS version. Then, it sends its public certificate to the client along with a request for the client’s certificate and its “server hello” message.

Upon receiving the certificate file, the browser validates it. Afterward, the client sends its own SSL certificate to the server.

The server then verifies the client’s SSL/TLS certificate and paves the way for a secure connection with it.
