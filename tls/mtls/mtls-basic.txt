Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security mechanism where both the client and the server authenticate each other using TLS certificates.

It’s like HTTPS, but two-way:


🚀
TLS (normal HTTPS):

Client verifies server certificate.

Server does NOT verify client certificate.

Only the server proves its identity.



🚀
mTLS (mutual TLS):

Client verifies server certificate.

Server verifies client certificate.

Both sides prove their identity → “mutual”.
