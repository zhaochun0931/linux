# Creating a Self-Signed Certificate, A self-signed certificate is a certificate that's signed with its own private key. 

1. create private key
2. create certificate signing request (CSR) from the private key, the important field is Common Name, which should be the exact Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of our domain
3. create a self-signed certificate with our existing private key and CSR


# generate private key
openssl genrsa -out server.key


# generate csr
openssl req -key server.key -new -out server.csr


req is a subcommand to generate or manage CSRs or self-signed certificates.




# or just create both the private key and CSR with a single command
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr



# sign with the private key
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt


This command uses the -req option to indicate that the input is a CSR (server.csr) and signs it with a private key to produce the certificate (server.crt).




















# one single command to create a private key and a self-signed certificate, this command will create a temporary CSR

openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa -keyout server.key -out server.crt


-x509
  the output is a self-signed certificate

-nodes
  do not encrypt the private key




# You can avoid the interactive prompts by using the -subj flag

openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa \
-keyout server.key -out server.crt \
-subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=MyOrg/OU=IT/CN=www.example.com"





openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
