X.509 certificates are digital documents that represent a user, computer, service, or device. A certificate authority (CA), subordinate CA, or registration authority issues X.509 certificates. The certificates contain the public key of the certificate subject. 

They don't contain the subject's private key, which must be stored securel





The public key consists of a string of random numbers and can be used to encrypt a message.






The most common algorithms used to generate public keys are:

Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
Digital signature algorithm (DSA)
