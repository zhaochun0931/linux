In one-way SSL authentication (Server Certificate Authentication), only the client validates the server; the server does not verify the client application. When implementing one-way SSL authentication, the server application shares its public certificate with the client






Let’s understand the TLS 1.3 handshake process a bit more in depth by breaking it down:

First, the client (browser) sends supported cipher suites and compatible SSL/TLS version to initiate the connection. This is called the “client hello” message.

In return, the web server checks the cipher suites and SSL/TLS version. Then, it shares its public certificate to the client along with the “server hello” message.

Upon receiving the certificate file, the client validates it. The browser then initiates the process of private key verification by generating and encrypting a “pre-master secret” using the public key of the SSL/TLS certificate.

In turn, the web server decrypts the pre-master secret with its private key and establishes a secure connection.

So that’s how the verification of the web server is done. This is called “one-way SSL/TLS.”
