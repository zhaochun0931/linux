SAN (Subject Alternative Name) is an extension in an SSL/TLS certificate that allows multiple domain names, subdomains, or IP addresses to be covered under a single certificate.


1. Multi-Domain Support, Allows a certificate to secure multiple domains/subdomains.
2. Avoids Common Name (CN) Limitations, The CN field only allows one hostname, but SAN allows many.
3. Essential for Modern Browsers, Some browsers ignore the CN field and only use SAN.
4. Used in Wildcard and Multi-Domain Certificates.
