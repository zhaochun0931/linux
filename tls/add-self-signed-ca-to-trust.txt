# add the self signed certificat ca to trust store in Ubuntu linx

# On Ubuntu/Debian:

cp myca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
update-ca-certificates





/usr/local/share/ca-certificates




This also creates a /etc/ssl/certs/myca.pem symlink pointing to the real file in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates


# ll /etc/ssl/certs/myca.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 41 May 10 01:18 /etc/ssl/certs/myca.pem -> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myca.crt
#















curl --cert server.crt --key server.key https://xiaoming.com











# On CentOS/RedHat:


sudo cp minio.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust
