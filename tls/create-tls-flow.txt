✅ generates a new RSA private key


openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048



✅
Let’s break it down piece by piece.

What each part means


✅ openssl

Runs the OpenSSL command-line tool.



✅ genrsa

Tells OpenSSL to generate an RSA private key.

RSA = public-key (asymmetric) cryptography

Produces a private key (the public key can be derived from it)



✅-out server.key

Specifies the output file where the private key is written.

File: server.key


✅ 2048

Key size in bits.

2048-bit RSA is:

Secure (current minimum recommended)

Widely compatible




✅
What file is created

server.key will contain something like:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----


This is:

PEM format

Base64-encoded

Unencrypted by default
