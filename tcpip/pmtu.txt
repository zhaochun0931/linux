What is PMTU?

  PMTU = Path Maximum Transmission Unit
  
  It’s the largest packet size (in bytes) that can be sent from source → destination without fragmentation along the path.
  
  Each hop (router) has an MTU (e.g., 1500 bytes for Ethernet). The minimum MTU along the route defines the PMTU.
  
  If you send packets larger than the PMTU with DF (Don’t Fragment) flag set, routers will drop them and reply with ICMP "Fragmentation Needed", allowing the sender to discover the PMTU.





Linux implements Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) using ICMP. When enabled, the kernel adjusts the packet size to avoid fragmentation.

Check if PMTU discovery is enabled

sysctl net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc


0 = Enabled (normal behavior)
1 = Disabled (always allow fragmentation)


root@host1:~# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc
net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc = 0
root@host1:~#
