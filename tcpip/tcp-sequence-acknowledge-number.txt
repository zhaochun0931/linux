TCP Sequence Number (SEQ)

Every byte of data in TCP is numbered.

The sequence number in a TCP segment identifies the position of the first byte of data in that segment relative to the start of the connection.

Example: If a connection starts with SEQ=1000 and the sender sends 100 bytes of data, the next segment will start with SEQ=1100.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as:

"This segment starts at byte number X of the stream."




ðŸ”¹ TCP Acknowledgment Number (ACK)

TCP is full-duplex, so both sides send data.

The acknowledgment number tells the peer:

"I have successfully received all bytes up to (Nâˆ’1). Please send me byte N next."

In other words, the ACK is the next expected byte.

Example:

Receiver gets data up to byte SEQ=2000.

It sends back ACK=2001.

That means: "I got everything up to 2000, now I want 2001 next."





ðŸ”¹ Example Timeline

Client sends data:

Seq=1000, Len=100  â†’  bytes 1000â€“1099


Server acknowledges:

Ack=1100  â†’  got everything up to 1099


Next client data:

Seq=1100, Len=50   â†’  bytes 1100â€“1149


Server acknowledges again:

Ack=1150

ðŸ”¹ How This Works With Retransmission

If a segment is lost (say Seq=1100), the receiver wonâ€™t advance its ACK.

It keeps sending Ack=1100 repeatedly â†’ this is a duplicate ACK.

The sender then retransmits the missing data.
