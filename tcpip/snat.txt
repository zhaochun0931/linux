1. What is SNAT?

SNAT stands for Source Network Address Translation.

It’s a technique used in networking to change the source IP address of outgoing packets.

Typically used when devices in a private network need to communicate with external networks (like the Internet) using a single public IP.






2. How SNAT works

Imagine you have a private network:

Private Network: 192.168.1.0/24
Router/Public IP: 203.0.113.10


A device inside (e.g., 192.168.1.100) wants to access the Internet.



Router rewrites the source IP of the outgoing packet:

Original:   192.168.1.100 → 8.8.8.8
After SNAT: 203.0.113.10 → 8.8.8.8


When the response comes back to 203.0.113.10, the router maps it back to 192.168.1.100.
