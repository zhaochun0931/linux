The socket buffer, or "SKB", is the most fundamental data structure in the Linux networking code. Every packet sent or received is handled using this data structure.

skbuffs are the buffers in which the linux kernel handles network packets. The packet is received by the network card, put into a skbuff and then passed to the network stack, which uses the skbuff all the time.
