In Linux, VRF stands for Virtual Routing and Forwarding. It's a technology that allows you to create multiple, isolated routing tables within a single Linux machine.




In Linux, VRF is implemented using iproute2 tools and relies on the vrf network interface type. 




ip link add <vrf_name> type vrf table <vrf_table_id>

<vrf_name> is the name of the VRF instance.

<vrf_table_id> is the identifier for the VRF's routing table (usually an integer, e.g., 100).






ip link set dev eth0 master <vrf_name>



ip link set dev <vrf_name> up
ip link set dev eth0 up
