MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit


MTU is the largest size (in bytes) of a packet (or frame) that can be sent in a single transmission unit over a network interface without needing to be fragmented.




Why MTU Matters:
If a packet is larger than the MTU, it must be fragmented (split into smaller pieces), which:

Increases overhead and latency

Can cause problems if intermediate routers or firewalls block fragments



If Don't Fragment (DF) bit is set and the packet exceeds the MTU, the packet is dropped.
