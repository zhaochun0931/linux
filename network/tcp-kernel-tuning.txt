sysctl -a | egrep -i net.core

sysctl -a | egrep -i ipv4




sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse

sysctl -w  net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=0


Timestamp Dependence: tcp_tw_reuse only works if net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps is also enabled (set to 1). 
Without timestamps, the kernel cannot verify if a "reused" packet is old or new, so it won't allow the reuse.
