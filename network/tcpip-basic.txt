One of them is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Reference Model and consists of 7 layers.

Application layer

Presentation layer

Session layer

Transport layer

Network layer

Data Link layer

Physical layer




The process of sending and receiving data over a network is commonly categorized into 7 layers. The layers are typically abbreviated as L1 - L7. You can think of data as passing through each of these layers in turn as it is sent or received from an application, with each layer being responsible for a particular part of the processing required to send or receive the data over the network.



In a modern enterprise or public cloud network, the layers commonly map as follows:
L5-7: all the protocols most application developers are familiar with. e.g. HTTP, FTP, SSH, SSL, DNS.
L4: TCP or UDP, including source and destination ports.
L3: IP packets and IP routing.
L2: Ethernet packets and Ethernet switching.





When sending data over the network, each layer in the network stack adds its own header containing the control/metadata the layer needs to process the packet as it traverses the network, passing the resulting packet on to the next layer of the stack. In this way the complete packet is produced, which includes all the control/metadata required by every layer of the stack, without any layer understanding the data or needing to process the control/metadata of adjacent network layers.








A packet that is sent by us, goes from the top and to the bottom of this list, each layer adding its own set of headers to the packet in what we call the encapsulation phase. 
When the packet finally reaches it's destination the packet goes backwards through the list and the headers are stripped out of the packet, one by one, each header giving the destination host all of the needed information for the packet data to finally reach the application or program that it was destined for.










TCP/IP architecture 



There is no universal agreement among people on just how many layers there are in the TCP/IP architecture. However, it is generally considered that there are 3 through 5 layers available, and in most pictures and explanations, there will be 4 layers discussed. We will, for simplicities sake, only consider those four layers that are generally discussed.

Application layer

Transport layer

Internet layer

Network Access layer








The IP protocol is also a connectionless protocol, which in turn means that IP does not "negotiate" a connection. a connection-oriented protocol on the other hand negotiates a connection (called a handshake) and then when all data has been sent, tears it down. TCP is an example of this kind of protocol, however, it is implemented on top of the IP protocol. 


IP is also known as an unreliable protocol, or simply put it does not know if a packet was received or not. It simply receives a packet from the transport layer and does its thing, and then passes it on to the network access layer, and then nothing more to it. It may receive a return packet, which traverses from network access layer to the IP protocol which does it's thing again, and then passes it on upwards to the Transport layer. However, it doesn't care if it gets a reply packet, or if the packet was received at the other end. 


IP headers


Total Length - bits 16 - 31. This field tells us how large the packet is in octets, including headers and everything. The maximum size is 65535 octets, or bytes, for a single packet. The minimum packet size is 576 bytes, not caring if the packet arrives in fragments or not. It is only recommended to send larger packets than this limit if it can be guaranteed that the host can receive it, according to RFC 791. However, these days most networks runs at 1500 byte packet size. This includes almost all ethernet connections, and most Internet connections.

Identification - bits 32 - 46. This field is used in aiding the reassembly of fragmented packets.

Flags - bits 47 - 49. This field contains a few miscellaneous flags pertaining to fragmentation. The first bit is reserved, but still not used, and must be set to 0. The second bit is set to 0 if the packet may be fragmented, and to 1 if it may not be fragmented. The third and last bit can be set to 0 if this was the last fragment, and 1 if there are more fragments of this same packet.

Fragment Offset - bits 50 - 63. The fragment offset field shows where in the datagram that this packet belongs. The fragments are calculated in 64 bits, and the first fragment has offset zero.

Time to live - bits 64 - 72. The TTL field tells us how long the packet may live, or rather how many "hops" it may take over the Internet. Every process that touches the packet must remove one point from the TTL field, and if the TTL reaches zero, the whole packet must be destroyed and discarded. This is basically used as a safety trigger so that a packet may not end up in an uncontrollable loop between one or several hosts. Upon destruction the host should return an ICMP Time exceeded message to the sender.












TCP characteristics

The TCP protocol resides on top of the IP protocol. It is a stateful protocol and has built-in functions to see that the data was received properly by the other end host. The main goals of the TCP protocol is to see that data is reliably received and sent, that the data is transported between the Internet layer and Application layer correctly, and that the packet data reaches the proper program in the application layer, and that the data reaches the program in the right order. All of this is possible through the TCP headers of the packet.

The TCP protocol looks at data as an continuous data stream with a start and a stop signal. The signal that indicates that a new stream is waiting to be opened is called a SYN three-way handshake in TCP, and consists of one packet sent with the SYN bit set. The other end then either answers with SYN/ACK or SYN/RST to let the client know if the connection was accepted or denied, respectively. If the client receives an SYN/ACK packet, it once again replies, this time with an ACK packet. At this point, the whole connection is established and data can be sent. During this initial handshake, all of the specific options that will be used throughout the rest of the TCP connection is also negotiated, such as ECN, SACK, etcetera.

While the datastream is alive, we have further mechanisms to see that the packets are actually received properly by the other end. This is the reliability part of TCP. This is done in a simple way, using a Sequence number in the packet. Every time we send a packet, we give a new value to the Sequence number, and when the other end receives the packet, it sends an ACK packet back to the data sender. The ACK packet acknowledges that the packet was received properly. The sequence number also sees to it that the packet is inserted into the data stream in a good order.

Once the connection is closed, this is done by sending a FIN packet from either end-point. The other end then responds by sending a FIN/ACK packet. The FIN sending end can then no longer send any data, but the other end-point can still finish sending data. Once the second end-point wishes to close the connection totally, it sends a FIN packet back to the originally closing end-point, and the other end-point replies with a FIN/ACK packet. Once this whole procedure is done, the connection is torn down properly.

As you will also later see, the TCP headers contain a checksum as well. The checksum consists of a simple hash of the packet. With this hash, we can with rather high accuracy see if a packet has been corrupted in any way during transit between the hosts.











Sequence Number - bit 32 - 63. The sequence number field is used to set a number on each TCP packet so that the TCP stream can be properly sequenced (e.g., the packets winds up in the correct order). The Sequence number is then returned in the ACK field to ackonowledge that the packet was properly received.

Acknowledgment Number - bit 64 - 95. This field is used when we acknowledge a specific packet a host has received. For example, we receive a packet with one Sequence number set, and if everything is okey with the packet, we reply with an ACK packet with the Acknowledgment number set to the same as the original Sequence number.












Basically, NAT allows a host or several hosts to share the same IP address in a way.


NAT servers translates the source and destination addresses of packets as we already said to different addresses. The NAT server receives the packet, rewrites the source and/or destination address and then recalculates the checksum of the packet. One of the most common usages of NAT is the SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) function. Basically, this is used in the above example if we can't afford or see any real idea in having a real public IP for each and every one of the clients. In that case, we use one of the private IP ranges for our local network (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and then we turn on SNAT for our local network. SNAT will then turn all 192.168.1.0 addresses into it's own public IP (for example, 217.115.95.34). This way, there will be 5-10 clients or many many more using the same shared IP address.

MTU

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size frame (packet), specified in bytes, that can be sent over a network interface. The MTU is a configurable setting. 
The default setting on most network devices globally, is 1,500 bytes.





Fragmentation

Fragmentation occurs when a packet is sent that exceeds the MTU of a network interface. The TCP/IP stack will break the packet into smaller pieces (fragments) that conform to the interface's MTU. 
Fragmentation occurs at the IP layer and is independent of the underlying protocol (such as TCP). 
When a 2,000-byte packet is sent over a network interface with an MTU of 1,500, the packet will be broken down into one 1,500-byte packet and one 500-byte packet.

Network devices in the path between a source and destination can either drop packets that exceed the MTU or fragment the packet into smaller pieces.




The Don’t Fragment bit in an IP packet

The Don’t Fragment (DF) bit is a flag in the IP protocol header. The DF bit indicates that network devices on the path between the sender and receiver must not fragment the packet. When a network device receives a packet with the Don’t Fragment bit set, and that packet exceeds the device's interface MTU, the standard behavior is for the device to drop the packet. The device sends an ICMP Fragmentation Needed message back to the original source of the packet.




TCP maximum segment size

TCP maximum segment size (MSS) is a setting that limits the size of TCP segments, which avoids fragmentation of TCP packets. Operating systems will typically use this formula to set MSS:

MSS = MTU - (IP header size + TCP header size)

The IP header and the TCP header are 20 bytes each, or 40 bytes total. So, an interface with an MTU of 1,500 will have an MSS of 1,460. But the MSS is configurable.

This setting is agreed to in the TCP three-way handshake when a TCP session is set up between a source and a destination. Both sides send an MSS value, and the lower of the two is used for the TCP connection






Path MTU Discovery
MSS is negotiated, but it might not indicate the actual MSS that can be used. This is because other network devices in the path between the source and the destination might have a lower MTU value than the source and destination. In this case, the device whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop the packet. The device will send back an ICMP Fragmentation Needed (Type 3, Code 4) message that contains its MTU. This ICMP message allows the source host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is called Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).




Latency and round-trip time
Network latency is governed by the speed of light over a fiber optic network. Network throughput of TCP is also effectively governed by the round-trip time (RTT) between two network devices.



Latency and round-trip time effects on TCP
Round-trip time has a direct effect on maximum TCP throughput. In TCP protocol, window size is the maximum amount of traffic that can be sent over a TCP connection before the sender needs to receive acknowledgement from the receiver. If the TCP MSS is set to 1,460 and the TCP window size is set to 65,535, the sender can send 45 packets before it has to receive acknowledgement from the receiver. If the sender doesn't get acknowledgement, it will retransmit the data. Here's the formula:

TCP window size / TCP MSS = packets sent

In this example, 65,535 / 1,460 is rounded up to 45.




TCP window scaling
TCP window scaling is a technique that dynamically increases the TCP window size to allow more data to be sent before an acknowledgement is required. In the previous example, 45 packets would be sent before an acknowledgement was required. If you increase the number of packets that can be sent before an acknowledgement is needed, you're reducing the number of times a sender is waiting for acknowledgement, which increases the TCP maximum throughput.





IP address


RFC 1918 is an Internet standard (IETF RFC 1918) that defines three blocks of IPv4 addresses for private internal networks – specifically, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 – which are not routable on the public internet. 


| Range                         | CIDR           | Notes                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | 10.0.0.0/8     | Very large private network (16 million addresses)                        |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | 172.16.0.0/12  | Medium-size private network (1 million addresses)                        |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | 192.168.0.0/16 | Small private network (65,536 addresses), commonly used in home networks |





RFC 1918 reserves the following blocks of IP addresses: 
Class A Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8).
Class B Range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12).
Class C Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16).
