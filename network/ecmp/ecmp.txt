ECMP = Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing

It is a routing strategy used in IP networks where multiple paths to a destination have the same cost (metric), and the router can use all of them simultaneously to forward traffic



Per-flow hashing

Most Linux/modern routers do per-flow ECMP.

Packets in the same flow (same source/dest IP & port) always follow the same path.

This avoids out-of-order packets.




Linux does per-flow ECMP by default
