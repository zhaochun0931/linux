ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s a Router

A router is a network device that forwards packets between different networks.

âœ… In simple terms:

A switch connects devices within one local network (LAN).

A router connects different networks, such as:

Your home LAN â†’ the Internet (WAN)

Two company subnets â†’ through a backbone

Containers or VMs on separate networks â†’ via routing rules









Only hosts with multiple network addresses can perform routing. The most basic routing operation is forwarding, which forwards packets received on one network interface to another network interface.





Routing is the process of forwarding packets based on the packet source address, the packet destination address, and other relevant information.
A route is the path taken by a packet. 
A router is a host or device that performs routing.






static and dynamic routing










To configure routing requires the "route" command, which is contained in the "net-tools" package.

To specify a network routing rule by using route, issue a command of the form:
route add -net ip_address netmask mask_address interface

route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0



route add default gw 10.1.1.2 eth2
