✅ What Are Socket Send & Receive Buffers in Linux?

Every TCP/UDP socket in Linux has two kernel-managed buffers:

1️⃣ Receive Buffer (rmem)

The receive buffer stores incoming packets until your application reads them using:

recv()

read()

recvfrom()

If the receive buffer is full:

Linux drops incoming packets (UDP)

TCP performs flow-control → remote sender slows down



2️⃣ Send Buffer (wmem)

The send buffer stores outbound data after your application calls:

send()

write()

Your program may think data was “sent,” but actually:

It’s placed into the kernel send buffer

The kernel sends it later (depending on congestion, TCP rules)

If the send buffer is full:

send() blocks (or returns EAGAIN for non-blocking sockets)






🔍 How Big Are These Buffers by Default?

Check current buffer limits:

sysctl net.core.rmem_default
sysctl net.core.wmem_default
sysctl net.core.rmem_max
sysctl net.core.wmem_max
