By default, Linux uses the Reno and CUBIC congestion control algorithm

#  Check TCP Congestion Control Algorithms on Linux, 
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control





TCP BBR is a TCP congestion control algorithm developed by Google. It tackles the shortcomings of traditional TCP congestion control algorithms (Reno or CUBIC). 
BBR stands for Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT.







TCP BBR is supported by Linux since kernel version 4.9. Use the following command to check your Linux kernel version.

uname -r





Once you have kernel 4.9 or above, edit sysctl.conf file.


# enable BBR

vi /etc/sysctl.conf



At the end of the config file, add the following lines.

net.core.default_qdisc=fq
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr




Save the file, and refresh your configuration by using this command,

sysctl -p
