In TCP, ACK stands for Acknowledgment.

It is a fundamental part of how TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and loss-free data delivery.

✅ What is an ACK in TCP?

An ACK is a control flag in the TCP header that tells the sender:

“I received your data up to this sequence number.”

Every TCP segment contains a sequence number and often includes an ACK number.



🎯 Why do we need ACK in TCP?

TCP ensures reliability. ACKs help with:

✓ 1. Confirming delivery

If a sender transmits data:

Seq = 1000
Length = 500 bytes


The receiver sends:

ACK = 1500


Meaning:

“I received bytes 1000–1499. Send the next bytes starting at 1500.”

✓ 2. Retransmission when packets are lost

If the sender does not receive an ACK within a timeout (RTO):

→ It retransmits the data.

✓ 3. Flow control (using window size)

ACKs include the window size, telling the sender how much more data it can send.

✓ 4. Congestion control (TCP Reno, CUBIC, etc.)

Duplicate ACKs (e.g., ACK=1500 repeated) indicate packet loss.



📌 Where is ACK in the TCP header?

TCP has flags, and ACK is one of them:

URG | ACK | PSH | RST | SYN | FIN


ACK is set for almost all packets after the initial SYN.




📡 Example of TCP handshake with ACK
3-way handshake:

1️⃣ Client → Server
SYN, Seq=100

2️⃣ Server → Client
SYN-ACK, Seq=300, Ack=101

3️⃣ Client → Server
ACK, Seq=101, Ack=301

Now the connection is established.

🧠 In simple words:

📌 ACK is how TCP says “I got your message.”
📌 Used for reliability, flow control, congestion control, and ordering.
