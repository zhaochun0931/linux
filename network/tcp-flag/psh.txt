the PSH flag (short for “Push”) in TCP often confuses people, but it’s quite simple once you understand what it really signals.


🧠 What the PSH Flag Means

TCP is a byte-stream protocol — data is sent as a continuous stream of bytes, not as discrete “messages.”
However, sometimes the sender wants the receiver to process the data immediately instead of waiting for the buffer to fill up.

That’s what the PSH (Push) flag is for.

Definition:
The PSH flag tells the receiver’s TCP stack:
“Deliver this data to the application right away — don’t wait for more.”





🔬 Without and With PSH
🔹 Without PSH

TCP may buffer received bytes in the kernel until:

The buffer is full, or

The application reads from the socket

So, if small packets arrive, the receiver’s app might not see them immediately.

🔹 With PSH

The sender sets the PSH flag to say:

“Hey, I’ve finished sending a chunk of meaningful data — please flush it to the app layer now.”

Then, the receiver’s TCP stack immediately delivers the bytes to the app (like your recv() call in Python).

📡 Typical Use in Real Life

When you use send() or sendall() in Python for small messages (like "Hello 1"), the kernel usually sets the PSH flag automatically at the end of each write.


⚠️ Common Misunderstandings

PSH ≠ urgent — it doesn’t mean “priority” or “faster delivery.” It just means “flush this to the app now.”

It’s not guaranteed per application write — the OS TCP stack may coalesce or split data differently.

PSH doesn’t affect reliability or ordering — only how quickly data reaches the receiving process.
