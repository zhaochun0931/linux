🚀 What Is OSPF?

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used within an Autonomous System (AS) — typically inside enterprise or datacenter networks.

It dynamically discovers network topology and computes the shortest path between routers using Dijkstra’s algorithm.


| Concept                              | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)** | Messages used to share topology info between routers.                                    |
| **Area**                             | Logical grouping of routers; all must have the same area ID (e.g. Area 0 = backbone).    |
| **Router ID**                        | Unique 32-bit ID (like an IP address) that identifies the router.                        |
| **Hello Protocol**                   | Used to discover and maintain neighbor relationships.                                    |
| **Cost**                             | Metric assigned to interfaces (lower = better). Computed from bandwidth or manually set. |
| **SPF Algorithm**                    | Dijkstra’s algorithm — computes shortest path tree to all destinations.                  |






🚀 How It Works

Routers send Hello packets to find OSPF neighbors.

Once neighbors are established, they exchange LSAs.

Each router builds a link-state database (LSDB) — a map of the entire area.

Each router independently computes the shortest path tree using Dijkstra.

The resulting routing table is installed in the kernel routing table.
