A TCP long connection (also called a persistent TCP connection) refers to a network connection where the client and server maintain an open connection over a longer period of time, rather than opening and closing it for each request-response cycle.











In a TCP long connection:

The connection remains open and idle between messages.

It's reused for multiple communications over time without re-establishing the connection.





In a typical TCP short connection:

A connection is established (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

One or a few requests are sent.

The connection is closed (FIN, ACK).
