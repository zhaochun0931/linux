While MTU is the limit for the whole packet, MSS (Maximum Segment Size) is the limit for the data inside the packet.



While MTU is the limit for the entire "envelope" (the packet), MSS (Maximum Segment Size) is the limit for the "letter" inside (the actual data).

It is a TCP-specific parameter that defines the largest amount of data a device can receive in a single, unfragmented segment.

1. The MathThe relationship between MTU and MSS is simple subtraction. 

To get the MSS, you take the MTU and subtract the fixed headers required for TCP/IP:


IP Header: 20 bytes
TCP Header: 20 bytes


MSS = MTU - 40



On a standard Ethernet network with an MTU of 1500, the MSS is 1460.
