🧠 What Is TCP Flow Control?

Flow control is how TCP prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.

It ensures that the sender only transmits as much data as the receiver can handle.



⚙️ The Key Mechanism: The Receive Window (rwnd)

Each TCP segment includes a window size field that tells the sender:

“You may send this many bytes beyond my last ACK before you must stop and wait.”
