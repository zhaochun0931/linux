🧠 What Is TCP Flow Control?

Flow control is how TCP prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.

It ensures that the sender only transmits as much data as the receiver can handle.



⚙️ The Key Mechanism: The Receive Window (rwnd)

Each TCP segment includes a window size field that tells the sender:

“You may send this many bytes beyond my last ACK before you must stop and wait.”



💡 Flow Control vs Congestion Control

| Concept                | Controls                      | Purpose           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Flow Control**       | *Receiver buffer size (rwnd)* | Protects receiver |
| **Congestion Control** | *Network congestion (cwnd)*   | Protects network  |




Both limit how much unacknowledged data can be sent:

Effective Window = min(rwnd, cwnd)
