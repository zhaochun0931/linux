Advanced Packaging Tool

apt is a newer, higher-level command that combines the functionality of several older tools (like apt-get and apt-cache) into a more user-friendly interface.

apt is a high-level tool that uses dpkg underneath but also handles the resolution of dependencies, fetching packages from repositories, and managing package upgrades.






apt list --installed
dpkg --get-selections




apt remove <package-name>


apt purge <package-name>



apt autoremove
