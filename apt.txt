✅
The recommended way to install Debian packages (“deb” files) is using the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)


apt is a newer, higher-level command that combines the functionality of several older tools (like apt-get and apt-cache) into a more user-friendly interface.

apt is a high-level tool that uses dpkg underneath but also handles the resolution of dependencies, fetching packages from repositories, and managing package upgrades.




✅
Update the package index


The APT package index is a database of available packages from the repositories defined in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. 



/etc/apt/sources.list

/etc/apt/sources.list.d


# Ubuntu sources have moved to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources





✅





apt list --installed


✅
apt remove <package-name>


✅
apt purge <package-name>

Adding the --purge option to apt remove will remove the package configuration files as well.


✅
apt autoremove







✅
To upgrade your system, first update your package index and then perform the upgrade – as follows:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade








dpkg -l
dpkg --get-selections






# (classic, lower-level)
dpkg -l
