SSH consists of three distinct layers:

The transport layer
The authentication layer
The connection layer




The two most common SSH user authentication methods used are passwords and SSH keys.



SSH uses three data encryption types during the communication between the machines. These are:
Symmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption
Hashing






Hashing algorithms used to produce hashes in SSH are Message Authentication Code (MAC) and Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
