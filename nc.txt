# netcat

# On Ubuntu, there are two versions of Netcat available: netcat and netcat-openbsd. The netcat-openbsd package is generally preferred because itâ€™s the OpenBSD variant, which is more actively maintained and has more features.


# Installing netcat might install either netcat-openbsd or netcat-traditional, depending on which package is available and preferred by your system.




apt install -y netcat
apt install -y netcat-openbsd
apt install -y netcat-traditional






nc -v -z localhost 80

nc -v -z localhost 80-81

# set up a tcp server
nc -l 0.0.0.0 8888
nc -l 8888

nc -lk 8888

     -k      When a connection is completed, listen for another one.  Requires -l.  When used together with the -u
             option, the server socket is not connected and it can receive UDP datagrams from multiple hosts.
