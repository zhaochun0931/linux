# Backing Up and Restoring Files, The most popular backup and restore command is tar. To back up a file or directory by using tar:

tar cvf tarfile.tar filex filey dirz

This command backs up the files filex and filey and the directory dirz, storing the backup in the file tarfile.tar


To restore the backup, issue a command such as:
tar xvf tarfile.tar







You can compress the backup file to reduce the amount of disk space required to store it. To specify compression when creating a backup, issue a
command such as:
tar zcvf tarfile.tgz filex filey dirz

where the z denotes compression. If a backup file is compressed, the z option must be used when restoring the files:
tar zxvf tarfile.tgz



# Mounting and Unmounting File Systems, You must mount a file system before you can access the files it contains.

mount â€“t ext2 /dev/hdb1 /mnt/data

This command mounts the ext2 file system residing on the partition /dev/hdb1 as the directory /mnt/data, which exist before the command is issued.
