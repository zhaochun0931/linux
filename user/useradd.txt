✅ useradd → low-level, script-friendly, minimal.
✅ adduser → high-level, human-friendly, interactive wrapper.



Each user is associated with a unique numerical identification number called a user ID (UID). Likewise, each group is associated with a group ID (GID).

useradd user1


✅ By default, the useradd command creates a locked user account. To unlock the account, run the following command as root to assign a password:

passwd username



passwd --status xiaoming1
passwd -S xiaoming1



# passwd --status xiaoming1
xiaoming1 LK 2025-11-05 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)
#
#
# passwd --status xiaoming2
xiaoming2 LK 2025-11-05 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)
# passwd -S xiaoming1
xiaoming1 LK 2025-11-05 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)
#







✅ Check /etc/shadow

sudo grep "^username:" /etc/shadow


testuser:!$6$XyP...:19888:0:99999:7:::


Explanation of the second field:

If it starts with ! or *, the account is locked.

If it’s a valid hash (e.g., $6$...), it’s active.




# su - user1
su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/xiaoming: No such file or directory
xiaoming@gf1:/root$






# -m Create the user's home directory if it does not exist. 

useradd -m user2



# -s specifies the user’s shell

useradd -m -s /bin/bash user3








useradd is a low-level utility that directly interfaces with system configuration files.  It performs minimal setup by creating a new user account but does not handle some of the additional setup tasks by default. After creating the account with useradd, you might need to run additional commands to set a password
