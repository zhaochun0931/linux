It is common to confuse expose with ports. Here is the difference:

ports: Publishes the port to the outside world (host machine and external network).   

expose: Only opens the port to other containers on the same Docker network. It does not map it to your host machine.




services:
  database:
    image: postgres
    expose:
      - "5432" # Only the 'web-app' container can see this, not you.
  
  web-app:
    image: my-app
    ports:
      - "80:8080" # You can access this at http://localhost:80
