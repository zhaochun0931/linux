In Linux, ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.
It’s the mechanism that maps an IP address (Layer 3) to a MAC address (Layer 2) on a local network.


arp -a





Why ARP exists

On Ethernet networks:

Applications talk using IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.10)

Network cards send frames using MAC addresses (e.g. aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff)

👉 ARP bridges this gap.




How ARP works (simple flow)

✅ Host wants to send a packet to 192.168.1.20

✅ It checks the ARP cache

✅ If no entry exists, it broadcasts:

Who has 192.168.1.20? Tell 192.168.1.10


✅ The target replies:

192.168.1.20 is at 52:54:00:ab:cd:ef


✅ The sender stores this mapping in the ARP table
