🏛️ What is FIPS?

FIPS are U.S. government standards published by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).
They define requirements for computer systems used by U.S. federal agencies — mainly around security and interoperability.

🔐 In the context of Linux and cryptography

When you hear “FIPS mode” in Linux, OpenSSL, or kernel settings, it refers to:

FIPS 140-2 (or 140-3) — a standard specifying the security requirements for cryptographic modules.

This means:

Only approved cryptographic algorithms (like AES, SHA-256, RSA) can be used.

Random number generation, encryption, and hashing must follow certified implementations.

Software or hardware that implements cryptography must be validated by NIST.
