ACL (Access Control List) in Linux is an extended permission system that allows you to give fine-grained permissions to files and directories beyond the standard owner / group / others model.

Most distros (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Fedora) no longer show acl explicitly in the mount options, because it is the default kernel behavior.




touch test.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 16 12:42 test.txt





setfacl -m u:username:rw test.txt


ls -l will show a + if ACL exists:

-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root root 0 Nov 16 12:42 test.txt


The + means: this file has extended ACL entries.

# getfacl test.txt
