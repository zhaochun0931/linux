ACL (Access Control List) in Linux is an extended permission system that allows you to give fine-grained permissions to files and directories beyond the standard owner / group / others model.

Most distros (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Fedora) no longer show acl explicitly in the mount options, because it is the default kernel behavior.
