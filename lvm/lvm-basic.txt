🧩 What is LVM?

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a storage abstraction layer built into Linux.
It sits between physical storage devices (like disks and partitions) and filesystems, letting you manage disk space flexibly — far beyond what static partitions allow.


Traditional disk layout:

Disk → Partition → Filesystem






With LVM:

Disk → PV (Physical Volume)
   ↓
Volume Group (VG)
   ↓
Logical Volume (LV)
   ↓
Filesystem (e.g., ext4, xfs)




This extra layer lets you resize, move, and combine storage dynamically — without rebooting or repartitioning.
