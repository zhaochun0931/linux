Receive ring buffers are shared between the device driver and network interface controller (NIC). The
card assigns a transmit (TX) and receive (RX) ring buffer. As the name implies, the ring buffer is a
circular buffer where an overflow overwrites existing data. There are two ways to move data from the
NIC to the kernel, hardware interrupts and software interrupts, also called SoftIRQs.

The kernel uses the RX ring buffer to store incoming packets until they can be processed by the device
driver. The device driver drains the RX ring, typically using SoftIRQs, which puts the incoming packets
into a kernel data structure called an sk_buff or skb to begin its journey through the kernel and up to
the application which owns the relevant socket.

The kernel uses the TX ring buffer to hold outgoing packets which are destined for the wire. These ring
buffers reside at the bottom of the stack and are a crucial point at which packet drop can occur, which in
turn will adversely affect network performance.
Increase the size of an Ethernet deviceâ€™s ring buffers if the packet drop rate causes applications to
report a loss of data, timeouts, or other issues.
