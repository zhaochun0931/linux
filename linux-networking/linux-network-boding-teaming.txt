In earlier versions of RHEL, network bonding was the default method for creating aggregated network interfaces. 

In RHEL 7, network teaming has been added as a solution. 

The main difference between these two is that network bonding happened completely in user space, whereas in network teaming, the
teamd daemon is added to allow interaction in user space as well. Even if both methods are still valid, network teaming is the preferred method.
