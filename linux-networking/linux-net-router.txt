If you have more than one network interface on a computer (typically two or more NICs), you can confi gure Linux as a router. 

To make this happen, all that is needed is a change to one kernel parameter that allows packet forwarding. 

To turn on the ip_forward parameter immediately and temporarily, type the following as root:



temporarily enable the packet forward
|
|
|
permanently enable the packet forward






[root@centos sysconfig]# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
0
[root@centos sysconfig]# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[root@centos sysconfig]#
[root@centos sysconfig]# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
1
[root@centos sysconfig]#



Packet forwarding (routing) is disabled by default, with the value of ip_forward set to 0. By setting it to 1, packet forwarding is immediately enabled.






To make this change permanent, you must add that value to the /etc/sysctl.conf fi le, so it appears as follows:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
