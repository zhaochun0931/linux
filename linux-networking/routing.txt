Only hosts with multiple network addresses can perform routing. The most basic routing operation is forwarding, which forwards packets received on one network interface to another network interface.


Routing is the process of forwarding packets based on the packet source address, the packet destination address, and other relevant information.
A route is the path taken by a packet. 
A router is a host or device that performs routing.


static and dynamic routing






Unless you enable IP forwarding, a host will not forward IP packets. The likely result is that network operations fail with the message "host unreachable."

# enable IP forwarding by editing the file /etc/sysctl.conf to include the line
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


# another way to enable IP forwarding is to manipulate the /proc file system.
echo “1” >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

The drawback of this method is that you will have to reissue the command each time you reboot the system.
