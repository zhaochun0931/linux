Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux), SELinux is a security enhancement module deployed on top of Linux.


SELinux confi gurations can only be set and modifi ed by the root user. Configuration and policy files are located in the /etc/selinux directory. The primary configuration file is the /etc/selinux/config file.


cat /etc/selinux/config




check selinux mode
|
|
|
configure selinux mode




To see SELinuxâ€™s current mode on your system, use the getenforce command. 

getenforce







To see both the current mode and the mode set in the confi guration fi le, use the sestatus command.

sestatus




To change the mode setting, you can use the setenforce newsetting, where newsetting is either 0 (permissive) or 1 (enforcing)






To disable SELinux, you must edit the SELinux confi guration file. Rebooting the system always changes the mode back to what is set in that confi guration file. 
The preferred method of changing the SELinux mode is to modify the configuration file and then reboot the system.
