find . -type f -iname "1.txt"


find . -type d




find -size +N

find -size -N




# find the normal files
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f














find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;
What happens:

find runs the cat command once per file found.

Each {} is replaced by a single file.












find . -type f -iname 1.txt -exec cat {} \;


# must use the "" if you want to use the wild characters

# the {} \; pattern is fixed 
# no space between {}
# no space between \;


the symbol “{}” (make sure to quote or escape it) represents the path to the file found





-exec cat {} \;

For each file found, execute the command cat {}:

  {} → placeholder for the file path found by find.
  
  \; → terminates the -exec command.







You can also use + instead of \; to reduce the number of cat invocations:

find . -type f -iname 1.txt -exec cat {} +


This groups multiple files into a single cat call → more efficient.













find . -type f -iname "*txt" -exec cat {} \;




# find files in last 30mins
find . -mmin -30


# 1 day before
find . -atime -1
