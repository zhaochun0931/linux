n OpenLDAP (and LDAP in general), the Base DN (Distinguished Name) is the "root" or starting point of your directory tree.

Think of it like the root folder (e.g., C:\ or /) in a file system. Every entry in your LDAP directory exists "underneath" this Base DN.

1. How it is Structured
The Base DN is usually derived from your organization's domain name to ensure it is unique. It is composed of Domain Components (DC).

Example Domain: example.com

Corresponding Base DN: dc=example,dc=com

If your company is techcorp.org, your Base DN would be dc=techcorp,dc=org.

2. Why is the Base DN Important?
The Base DN serves two critical purposes:

Search Scope: When an application (like Keycloak, Jenkins, or a Linux login) looks for a user, it needs to know where to start looking. Providing the Base DN tells the application: "Start at this point and search everything inside this branch."

Unique Identity: Every object in LDAP has a "Full Path" called a DN. The Base DN forms the suffix of every single entry.

User: uid=john

Organizational Unit: ou=users

Full Path (DN): uid=john,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com



4. How to find your Base DN
If you are logged into a server and unsure what the Base DN is, you can query the Root DSE (Directory Server Entry), which usually holds this information:


ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -s base -b "" namingContexts

The output under namingContexts is your Base DN.


# ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -s base -b "" namingContexts
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <> with scope baseObject
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: namingContexts
#

#
dn:
namingContexts: dc=example,dc=com

# search result
