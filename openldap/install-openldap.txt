Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) uses schemas to define the structure of the directory data



Each piece of information in OpenLDAP is stored as an entry. An entry consists of a Distinguished Name (DN), which is a unique identifier, and a set of attributes. 
Attributes hold the actual data, such as the user's name or email address. 





Installing slapd (the Stand-alone LDAP Daemon) creates a minimal working configuration with a top level entry, and an administratorâ€™s Distinguished Name (DN).

In particular, it creates a database instance that you can use to store your data. However, the suffix (or base DN) of this instance will be determined from the domain name of the host. If you want something different, you can change it right after the installation (before it contains any useful data).


This guide will use a database suffix of dc=example,dc=com















# install openladap
apt update
apt install slapd ldap-utils -y



Please enter the password for the admin entry in your LDAP directory.
Adminstrator password: admin
