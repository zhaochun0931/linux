Authentication Using ldapsearch Command



We can use the ldapsearch command to perform LDAP authentication. In essence, we can use three different authentication schemes:

anonymous bind
simple plaintext-based authentication
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)


Notably, SASL is a more complex approach.








1. Using Anonymous Bind

Anonymous bind is the most basic method of client authentication. It’s used when there’s no need for authentication, i.e., for certain public areas of the LDAP directory. In such cases, a user requires no identity or password for the given operations against the LDAP server.

Let’s process a search against our server using the ldapsearch command. Basically, the ldapsearch command looks for the entries in the LDAP database and returns the results.

Now, let’s use the -x option with the ldapsearch command for an anonymous bind:


ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap:/// -b dc=example,dc=com dn
