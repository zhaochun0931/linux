Authentication Using ldapsearch Command



We can use the ldapsearch command to perform LDAP authentication. In essence, we can use three different authentication schemes:

anonymous bind
simple plaintext-based authentication
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)


Notably, SASL is a more complex approach.
