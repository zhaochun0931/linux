Authentication Using ldapsearch Command



We can use the ldapsearch command to perform LDAP authentication. In essence, we can use three different authentication schemes:

anonymous bind
simple plaintext-based authentication
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)


Notably, SASL is a more complex approach.








1. Using Anonymous Bind

Anonymous bind is the most basic method of client authentication. It’s used when there’s no need for authentication, i.e., for certain public areas of the LDAP directory. In such cases, a user requires no identity or password for the given operations against the LDAP server.

Let’s process a search against our server using the ldapsearch command. Basically, the ldapsearch command looks for the entries in the LDAP database and returns the results.

Now, let’s use the -x option with the ldapsearch command for an anonymous bind:


ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap:/// -b dc=example,dc=com dn


Since we’ve not given any Bind DN using the -D option, no password is needed. Consequently, we have an anonymous bind.

ldapsearch -H ldap://localhost -x
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.0.0.5 -x






2. Using Simple Bind
In simple authentication or simple bind, the DN of the account entry verifies that account for authentication. Along with that, it uses a password to confirm who we are.

Here’s the syntax for a simple bind or plain text authentication command:

ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap-server-hostname_or_IP -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -b "dc=example,dc=com"


We can put the values in the above expression as per our requirements:

ldap-server-hostname – LDAP server’s hostname or IP address
-D – user we want to authenticate with
-b – DN of the search base
Importantly, the -x option means we use simple authentication. The -W option asks for the password of the user at runtime.


ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.0.0.4 -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -b "dc=example,dc=com"
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -b "dc=example,dc=com"
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.example.com -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -b "dc=example,dc=com"
