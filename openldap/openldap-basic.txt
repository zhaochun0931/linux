OpenLDAP is an open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).





DIT (Directory Information Tree)

LDAP organizes data in a hierarchical tree structure.

Top-level is the root, then domains, organizational units (OU), groups, and users.

Example:

dc=example,dc=com
 ├─ ou=people
 │   ├─ uid=john
 │   └─ uid=alice
 └─ ou=groups
     └─ cn=admins


dc = domain component

ou = organizational unit

uid = user ID

cn = common name (often used for groups)






b) DN (Distinguished Name)

Every entry has a unique DN, which identifies it in the tree.

Example:

uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com


DN is like a full path to an entry.











🔴 Root DN (Directory Manager DN / Admin DN)

The Root DN is the administrator account for the database.

cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com




🔴 Base DN (Base Distinguished Name)

The Base DN is the top-level entry of your LDAP directory where your data (users, groups, OUs) is stored.

dc=example,dc=com


✅ Base DN




DN: Distinguished Name

In OpenLDAP, a DN (Distinguished Name) is the unique identifier for each entry in the LDAP directory.






Base DN = dc=example,dc=com

Admin DN = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com












A DN is like a full path to an object in the LDAP hierarchy — similar to a file path in a filesystem.

Example:
cn=John Doe,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

Breakdown:
cn=John Doe → Common name (entry for a person)

ou=users → Organizational unit

dc=example,dc=com → Domain components (root of the directory)

Together, they uniquely identify a specific object.






CN: Common Name
OU: Organization Unit
O: Organization
C: Country
DC: Domain Component





In OpenLDAP, cn stands for Common Name. It is a commonly used naming attribute in Distinguished Names (DNs), typically representing:

A person's full name

A group name

Or even descriptive labels (like cn=admin, cn=LDAP Server, etc.)











In OpenLDAP, the Base DN (Distinguished Name) is the root of the LDAP directory tree under which all entries are stored. It defines where LDAP searches start.

If your LDAP domain is:

example.com

Then the Base DN is usually:

dc=example,dc=com






entry — A single unit within an LDAP directory. Each entry is identified by its unique Distinguished Name (DN).





In OpenLDAP, dc stands for Domain Component. It is used to represent parts of a domain name in the Distinguished Name (DN) of LDAP entries.

dc=example,dc=com
└── ou=users
    └── cn=alice
