DN: Distinguished Name

In OpenLDAP, a DN (Distinguished Name) is the unique identifier for each entry in the LDAP directory.




A DN is like a full path to an object in the LDAP hierarchy — similar to a file path in a filesystem.

Example:
cn=John Doe,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

Breakdown:
cn=John Doe → Common name (entry for a person)

ou=users → Organizational unit

dc=example,dc=com → Domain components (root of the directory)

Together, they uniquely identify a specific object.






CN: Common Name
OU: Organization Unit
O: Organization
C: Country
DC: Domain Component





In OpenLDAP, cn stands for Common Name. It is a commonly used naming attribute in Distinguished Names (DNs), typically representing:

A person's full name

A group name

Or even descriptive labels (like cn=admin, cn=LDAP Server, etc.)











In OpenLDAP, the Base DN (Distinguished Name) is the root of the LDAP directory tree under which all entries are stored. It defines where LDAP searches start.

If your LDAP domain is:

example.com

Then the Base DN is usually:

dc=example,dc=com






entry — A single unit within an LDAP directory. Each entry is identified by its unique Distinguished Name (DN).





In OpenLDAP, dc stands for Domain Component. It is used to represent parts of a domain name in the Distinguished Name (DN) of LDAP entries.

dc=example,dc=com
└── ou=users
    └── cn=alice
