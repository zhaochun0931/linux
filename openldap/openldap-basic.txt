DN: Distinguished Name

In OpenLDAP, a DN (Distinguished Name) is the unique identifier for each entry in the LDAP directory.




A DN is like a full path to an object in the LDAP hierarchy — similar to a file path in a filesystem.

Example:
cn=John Doe,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

Breakdown:
cn=John Doe → Common name (entry for a person)

ou=users → Organizational unit

dc=example,dc=com → Domain components (root of the directory)

Together, they uniquely identify a specific object.






CN: Common Name
OU: Organization Unit
O: Organization
C: Country
DC: Domain Component






In OpenLDAP, the Base DN (Distinguished Name) is the root of the LDAP directory tree under which all entries are stored. It defines where LDAP searches start.

If your LDAP domain is:

example.com

Then the Base DN is usually:

dc=example,dc=com






entry — A single unit within an LDAP directory. Each entry is identified by its unique Distinguished Name (DN).
