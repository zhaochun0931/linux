strace is a powerful command-line tool in Linux used for tracing system calls and signals



System calls are the primary interface between a user-level program and the Linux kernel.




strace ls
strace -o /tmp/output ls 





Basic Structure of strace Output:

1. System Call Name: The name of the system call (e.g., open, read, write, execve).
2. Arguments: The arguments passed to the system call.
3. Return Value: The return value of the system call (often an integer or pointer).
4. Error Codes: If the system call fails, it will display an error code (usually -1 with errno value).




execve
the system call used to execute a program

brk
a system call used to control the program's heap memory.

openat
a system call used to open a file or directory. It's a more flexible version of open, allowing you to specify relative file paths from a directory file descriptor.

openat(AT_FDCWD, "demo_file.txt", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 3

Return Value: = 3 means that the system call was successful, and the file descriptor returned is 3
