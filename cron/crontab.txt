Cron is a service that enables you to schedule running a task, often called a job, at regular times.

Users specify cron jobs in cron table files, also called crontab files. These files are then read by the crond service, which executes the jobs.


# ps -ef | egrep -i cron
root        1065       1  0 Jun27 ?        00:00:41 /usr/sbin/crond -n
#


The root user uses the cron table in /etc/crontab, or, preferably, creates a cron table file in /etc/cron.d/.





1. Choose:

in which minutes of an hour to execute the job. For example, use 0,10,20,30,40,50 or 0/10 to specify every 10 minutes of an hour.
in which hours of a day to execute the job. For example, use 17-20 to specify time from 17:00 to 20:59.
in which days of a month to execute the job. For example, use 15 to specify 15th day of a month.
in which months of a year to execute the job. For example, use Jun,Jul,Aug or 6,7,8 to specify the summer months of the year.
in which days of the week to execute the job. For example, use * for the job to execute independently of the day of week.

Combine the chosen values into the time specification. The above example values result into this specification:
0,10,20,30,40,50 17-20 15 Jun,Jul,Aug *

2. Specify the user. The job will execute as if run by this user. For example, use root.

3. Specify the command to execute. For example, use /usr/local/bin/my-script.sh

4. Put the above specifications into a single line:

0,10,20,30,40,50 17-20 15 Jun,Jul,Aug * root /usr/local/bin/my-script.sh






Put the shell script into one of the following directories:
/etc/cron.hourly/
/etc/cron.daily/
/etc/cron.weekly/
/etc/cron.monthly/
