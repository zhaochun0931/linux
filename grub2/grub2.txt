version 2 of the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB2), which allows the user to select an operating system or kernel to be loaded at system boot time.
GRUB 2 also allows the user to pass arguments to the kernel.



GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg file on UEFI machines.


The GRUB 2 configuration file, grub.cfg, is generated during installation, or by invoking the /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig utility
