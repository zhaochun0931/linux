The BIOS startup

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) performs the POST (power on self-test) to detect, test and initialize the system hardware components.
It then loads the MBR (Master Boot Record).



The Master boot record (MBR)

The Master Boot Record is the first 512 bytes of the boot disk. The MBR discovers the boot device and loads the bootloader GRUB2 into memory and transfers
control to it.
The next 64 bytes contain the partition table of the disk.



The GRUB2 bootloader

The default bootloader for the Rocky 8 distribution is GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader). GRUB2 replaces the old GRUB bootloader (also called GRUB legacy).
The GRUB 2 configuration file is located under /boot/grub2/grub.cfg but this file should not be edited directly.


The kernel
The kernel starts the systemd process with PID 1.
root 1 0 0 02:10 ? 00:00:02 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 23



systemd
Systemd is the parent of all system processes. It reads the target of the /etc/systemd/system/default.target link (e.g., /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target) 
to determine the default target of the system. The file defines the services to be started.

Systemd then places the system in the target-defined state by performing the following initialization tasks:
Set the machine name
Initialize the network
Initialize SELinux
Display the welcome banner
Initialize the hardware based on the arguments given to the kernel at boot time
Mount the file systems, including virtual file systems like /proc
Clean up directories in /var
Start the virtual memory (swap)
