When a program runs, the system will create a process by placing the program data and code in memory and creating a runtime stack. 

A process is an instance of a program with an associated processor environment (ordinal counter, registers, etc...) and memory environment.



The ps command allows you to display information about running processes. It produces a static list, that is, a snapshot of what is running when you execute the command.




There is a parent/child relationship between processes. A child process results from the parent calling the fork() primitive and duplicating its code to create a child. The PID of the child is returned to the parent process so that it can talk to it. Each child has its parent's identifier, the PPID.







The end-of-process sequencing is as follows:
1. Closing of the open files
2. Release of the used memory
3. Sending a signal to the parent and child processes
When a parent process dies, their children are said to be orphans. They are then adopted by the init process, which will destroy them.





Processes can run in two ways:
synchronous: the user loses access to the shell during command execution. The command prompt reappears at the end of the process execution.
asynchronous: the process is processed in the background. The command prompt is displayed again immediately.




This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:
1. UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
2. BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
3. GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.






ps ax

For each listed process, the ps ax command displays the process ID (PID), the terminal that is associated with it (TTY), the current status (STAT), the cumulated CPU time (TIME), and the name of the executable file (COMMAND).
