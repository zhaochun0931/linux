With sudo, a regular user is given root privileges, but only when that user runs the sudo command to run another command. 
After running that one command with sudo, the user is immediately returned to a shell and acts as the regular user again.





ðŸ§© Goal:

Letâ€™s say you want user bob to run commands with sudo.

ðŸ§­ Option 1 â€” Add the user to the sudo group (recommended on Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo usermod -aG sudo bob


Then verify:

groups bob





export EDITOR=vi








ðŸ§­ Option 3 â€” Grant sudo to a specific user (fine-grained)

If you donâ€™t want to use groups:

sudo visudo


Then add at the end:

bob ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


or (safer)

bob ALL=(ALL) ALL


The first form (NOPASSWD) lets them run sudo without a password prompt.
