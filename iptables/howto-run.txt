🔹 Option 1: Drop pings silently (no reply)
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP


The system will ignore incoming pings.
From the sender’s side, it looks like the host is unreachable (no reply at all).




🔹 Option 2: Reject pings politely (send an error back)
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j REJECT


The system replies with “ICMP Destination Unreachable”.

The sender knows the ping was explicitly rejected.
