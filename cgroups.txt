Cgroups (Control Groups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows you to allocate, manage, and limit system resources (CPU, memory, I/O, network, etc.) for processes or groups of processes.


There are two versions of cgroups in Linux:

1. Cgroups v1
Resources are managed in separate hierarchical groups (e.g., cpu, memory, blkio are separate groups).
Each controller (e.g., cpu, memory) has its own directory structure.
Used in older Linux distributions.


2. Cgroups v2
Introduces a unified hierarchy where all resources can be managed together.
More flexible and efficient for modern containerized workloads.
Used by default in newer Linux distributions (e.g., RHEL 8+, Ubuntu 20.04+).





To check which version is in use:

stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/

If output is cgroup2fs, then Cgroups v2 is enabled.
Otherwise, it's using Cgroups v1.
