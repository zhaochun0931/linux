ðŸ§© What is journalctl

Purpose: View and query the systemd journal, which stores logs from:

Kernel (dmesg)

System services (systemd, nginx, docker, etc.)

User applications (if they log to stdout/stderr)

Storage: Logs are usually in binary format, located in:

/run/log/journal/ â†’ volatile (lost on reboot)

/var/log/journal/ â†’ persistent


Unlike plain text logs in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages, journalctl can filter by time, service, priority, or boot session.
