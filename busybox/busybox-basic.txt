BusyBox and GNU Coreutils provide similar Linux commands, but they are designed with opposite goals.

BusyBox is a single small executable that provides many common Linux command-line utilities in a compact, lightweight form.



🪶 1. BusyBox = Minimal + Lightweight
BusyBox is called the "Swiss Army Knife for Linux" — it packs many basic commands into one small binary.


💪 2. GNU Coreutils = Full-featured + Complete

GNU Coreutils is the official GNU implementation of Linux commands.
