BusyBox and GNU Coreutils provide similar Linux commands, but they are designed with opposite goals.


🪶 1. BusyBox = Minimal + Lightweight
BusyBox is called the "Swiss Army Knife for Linux" — it packs many basic commands into one small binary.


💪 2. GNU Coreutils = Full-featured + Complete

GNU Coreutils is the official GNU implementation of Linux commands.
