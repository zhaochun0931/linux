Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)


rpm -qa




Most packages are simply installed with the upgrade option, -U, whether the package is already installed or not.

rpm -Uvh /path/to/rpm-package(s)

The -v option generates more verbose output, and -h makes rpm print a progress bar




rpm -qf /usr/bin/nc







Remove using rpm

sudo rpm -e <package_name>
