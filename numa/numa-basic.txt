NUMA stands for Non-Uniform Memory Access. It’s a computer memory design used in multi-processor systems to improve performance.



Here’s a clear breakdown:

🚀 What NUMA Means

In a NUMA system, CPU cores are grouped into nodes.

Each node has local memory attached directly to it.

Accessing local memory is faster than accessing memory attached to a different node (remote memory).

So memory access speed is non-uniform → hence the name.






🚀 Why NUMA Exists

Traditional SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) has all CPUs sharing the same memory.

As the number of CPUs grows, memory contention becomes a bottleneck.

NUMA scales better because each CPU node accesses its own memory first.
