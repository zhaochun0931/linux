SSH consists of three distinct layers:

The transport layer
The authentication layer
The connection layer




The two most common SSH user authentication methods used are passwords and SSH keys.



SSH uses three data encryption types during the communication between the machines. These are:
Symmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption
Hashing






Hashing algorithms used to produce hashes in SSH are Message Authentication Code (MAC) and Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)







ssh username@host

ssh 'username@email'@host









create a pair of two keys consisting of a public and a private key

ssh-keygen


~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - public key
~/.ssh/id_rsa - private key


# file *
id_rsa:     OpenSSH private key
id_rsa.pub: OpenSSH RSA public key
#



The public key does not need to be secret. It is used to verify the private key. The private key is secret.

Copy the most recently modified public key to a remote machine you want to log into:
ssh-copy-id username@localhost
