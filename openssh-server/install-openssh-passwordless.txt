# passwordless configuration

ssh-keygen

# will generate id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
-rw-------. 1 root root 2590 Feb 13 13:45 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  562 Feb 13 13:45 id_rsa.pub


By default the public key is saved in the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, while ~/.ssh/id_rsa is the private key. 
Now copy the id_rsa.pub file to the remote host and append it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys by entering:

ssh-copy-id username@remotehost



-rw-------. 1 root root  562 Feb 13 13:47 authorized_keys
-rw-------. 1 root root 2590 Feb 13 13:45 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  562 Feb 13 13:45 id_rsa.pub





Finally, double check the permissions on the authorized_keys file, only the authenticated user should have read and write permissions. 
If the permissions are not correct change them by:

chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys


You should now be able to SSH to the host without being prompted for a password.
