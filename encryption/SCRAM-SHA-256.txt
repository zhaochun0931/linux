2️⃣ SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication

Method: Password-based authentication using SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) with SHA-256.

How it works:

Server stores a salted SHA-256 hash of the password.

Client and server perform a challenge-response protocol, never sending the password in clear or just MD5.
