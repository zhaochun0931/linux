MD5 algorithm, a one-way cryptographic hash function. 


The MD5 algorithm processes any input, such as a file or text string, and produces a fixed-length, 32-character hexadecimal output called a "hash" or "checksum". 
The MD5 hash for any specific file or string will always be the same. For example, the hash for the word "hello" is always 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592. 
The hash is useful because even a tiny change in the original input will produce a completely different hash value. 



How MD5 is used

Checking data integrity:
  A common use for MD5 is to verify that a downloaded file has not been corrupted during transfer. 
  Many websites provide the MD5 checksum for files, which you can compare with the checksum of your downloaded copy. If they match, the file is intact.


Generating unique IDs: It can be used to create unique identifiers for data in databases and software development.
