The Journal is a component of systemd that is responsible for viewing and management of log files. It can be used in parallel, or in place of a traditional syslog daemon, such as rsyslogd.

Logging data is collected, stored, and processed by the Journal’s journald service.


To access the journal logs, use the journalctl tool.





🧩 What is journalctl

Purpose: View and query the systemd journal, which stores logs from:

Kernel (dmesg)

System services (systemd, nginx, docker, etc.)

User applications (if they log to stdout/stderr)

Storage: Logs are usually in binary format, located in:

/run/log/journal/ → volatile (lost on reboot)

/var/log/journal/ → persistent


Unlike plain text logs in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages, journalctl can filter by time, service, priority, or boot session.





✅ Basic Usage

✅ View the entire journal

journalctl




journalctl -f

journalctl -n 100





✅ Filter by service

sudo journalctl -u ssh
sudo journalctl -u docker


-u = systemd unit (service)









✅ Filter by time

sudo journalctl --since "2025-10-25 09:00" --until "2025-10-25 10:00"


✅ Filter by priority

sudo journalctl -p err
sudo journalctl -p warning


Priority levels:

emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug



✅ Filter by boot

sudo journalctl -b       # current boot
sudo journalctl -b -1    # previous boot


✅ Output formats

sudo journalctl -o short  # default
sudo journalctl -o json    # JSON output
sudo journalctl -o cat     # only message text
