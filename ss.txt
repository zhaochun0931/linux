A port in Linux is a virtual concept that helps in accessing different services within a network. It is a 16-bit integer ranging from 0 to 65535 with no physical existence. 
A port, when combined with an IP address, results in a socket address that is used to establish a connection between the client and the server.


A port that is actively accepting connections is called an open port. The connection thus established is used to access the service associated with that port.

A port can be occupied by a single service/process at a time.



ss (Socket Statistics) 

apt install -y iproute2

Here we have used four options to get the desired output:

t: display TCP sockets
n: display the numeric port number
l: display listening sockets
p: Display the process using the socket
