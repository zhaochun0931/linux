Systemd is the init system and service manager used by most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, etc.). It’s responsible for booting the system, managing services, logging, and more.

In simple terms:

systemd is the thing that starts everything on your Linux system — and manages it while it's running.


Replaces older systems like SysV init and Upstart.




Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system
services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, systemd replaces Upstart as the default init system.
Systemd introduces the concept of systemd units. These units are represented by unit configuration files located in one of the following directories listed.

/usr/lib/systemd/system/
/run/systemd/system/
/etc/systemd/system/












Built-in logging (journald)
