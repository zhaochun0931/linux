NumPy (Numerical Python) is the core library for fast numerical computing in Python.

Almost everything in scientific Python (pandas, SciPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn) is built on top of it.



✅ Core idea: ndarray

NumPy’s main object is the N-dimensional array (ndarray).




✅ Why NumPy is FAST

Data stored in contiguous memory

Implemented in C

Uses vectorization (no Python loops)
