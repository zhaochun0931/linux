The /proc filesystem is one of the most critical components of the kernel. It is a virtual filesystem that exists only in memory. 



The /proc filesystem is the "single point of truth" (SPOT) for obtaining information about the running system and changing the kernel-tuning variables.




Making changes to the running kernel


One of the first things I need to tune on the Linux host I use for a router is to enable it to be a router. This is accomplished by setting the contents of the file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1



First, I can use the command:

# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward



The sysctl command does exactly the same thing: it sets the value of that file to 1:

#  sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1











Making the changes permanent

Making these changes permanent is quite easy. Just add the following lines to the /etc/sysctl.conf file or to a new file in /etc/sysctl.d
