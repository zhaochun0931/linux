Single Quotes (' ') provide strong quoting; they preserve the literal value of every character within them. No shell expansions occur.

Double Quotes (" ") provide weak quoting; they preserve the literal value of most characters but still allow certain shell expansions to be interpreted, specifically $, `, and \ (when used to escape another special character or a newline). 










echo hello world
echo 'hello world'
echo "hello world"


echo -e "hello \n world"
