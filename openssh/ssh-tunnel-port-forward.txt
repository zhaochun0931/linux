Port forwarding works by mapping a local port on the client to a remote port on the server. SSH can map any port from the server to any port on the client.





ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port user@jumbox_ssh_server


ssh -L local_address:local_port:remote_address:remote_port user@jumbox_ssh_server



ssh -l username host
