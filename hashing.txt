What is hashing?

Cryptography uses hashing to confirm that a file is unchanged. The simple explanation is that the same hashing method is used on a file at each end of an Internet download. 
The file is hashed on the web server by the web administrator, and the hash result is published. 

A user downloads the file and applies the same hash method. The hash results, or checksums, are compared. 
If the checksum of the downloaded file is the same as that of the original file, then the two files are identical, and there have been no unexpected changes due to file corruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc.

Hashing is a one-way process. The hashed result cannot be reversed to expose the original data. 
The checksum is a string of output that is a set size. Technically, that means that hashing is not encryption because encryption is intended to be reversed (decrypted).


In Linux, you're likely to interact with one of two hashing methods:

MD5
SHA256


Message Digest versus Secure Hash Algorithm
What's the difference between the message digest and secure hash algorithms? The difference is in the mathematics involved, but the two accomplish similar goals. Sysadmins might prefer one over the other, but for most purposes, they function similarly.
