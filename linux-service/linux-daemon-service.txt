Systemd





The Linux kernel has a process ID (PID) of 0. Thus, the initialization process (init or systemd) daemon has a parent process ID (PPID) of 0, and a PID of 1.





The Linux init daemon was based upon the UNIX System V init daemon. Thus, it is called the SysVinit daemon. However, it was not the only classic init daemon. The init daemon is not part of the Linux kernel. 
Therefore, it can come in different fl avors, and Linux distributions can choose which fl avor to use. Another classic init daemon was based on Berkeley UNIX, also called BSD. 
Therefore, the two original Linux init daemons were BSD init and SysVinit.
