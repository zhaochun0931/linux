OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.








The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

libssl an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 (RFC 8446), DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 (RFC 6347) and the QUIC version 1 protocol (RFC 9000).

libcrypto a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.

openssl the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks, testing and analyzing. It can be used for

creation of key parameters
creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
calculation of message digests
encryption and decryption
SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
QUIC client tests
handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
and more...








The OpenSSL configuration file is located at /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf and is used both by the library itself and the command-line tools included in the package.
