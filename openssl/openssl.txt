The OpenSSL configuration file is located at /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf and is used both by the library itself and the command-line tools included in the package.

/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf



openssl version

openssl version -a

✅ How OpenSSL finds the config file

If you specify -config <file> → uses that file


else, OpenSSL uses the compiled default:

OPENSSLDIR/openssl.cnf








✅ What basicConstraints means

The Basic Constraints extension tells a certificate:

Whether it is allowed to act as a Certificate Authority (CA)


2️⃣ basicConstraints = CA:TRUE

Meaning

This certificate can issue other certificates.

Used for:

Root CAs

Intermediate CAs


Key Usage (often combined)

keyCertSign

cRLSign




3️⃣ basicConstraints = CA:FALSE

Meaning

This is a leaf / end-entity certificate

Cannot issue other certificates



Usually used for:

HTTPS server certs

Client certificates

Email certificates



Key Usage (often combined)

digitalSignature

keyEncipherment

serverAuth or clientAuth in extendedKeyUsage





Root CA (CA:TRUE)
│
├─ Intermediate CA (CA:TRUE)
│   └─ Server cert (CA:FALSE)
│
└─ Another Intermediate (CA:TRUE)
    └─ Client cert (CA:FALSE)
