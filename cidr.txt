CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
It’s a way to represent IP address ranges and subnet sizes more flexibly than the old “class A/B/C” system.


✅

CIDR notation
IP-address/prefix-length


Example:

192.168.1.0/24


192.168.1.0 → network address

/24 → number of network bits

Remaining bits → host addresses




What /24 means

IPv4 has 32 bits total.

/24 = 24 bits for network
      8 bits for hosts


Number of addresses:

2^8 = 256


Usable hosts:

256 - 2 = 254


(network + broadcast are reserved)




✅
CIDR vs subnet mask

They mean the same thing:

/24  ⇔  255.255.255.0
/16  ⇔  255.255.0.0


CIDR is shorter and clearer.






  

Trick 1️⃣: Host count from CIDR (instant)

Formula (IPv4):

Hosts = 2^(32 − prefix) − 2

Memorize these anchors
| CIDR | Hosts |
| ---- | ----- |
| /24  | 254   |
| /25  | 126   |
| /26  | 62    |
| /27  | 30    |
| /28  | 14    |
| /29  | 6     |
| /30  | 2     |
| /32  | 1     |


💡 Pattern: each /+1 → half the hosts





Trick 2️⃣: Block size shortcut (subnet jumping)

Block size = 256 − subnet mask octet

Example:

/26 → 255.255.255.192
Block size = 256 − 192 = 64


So networks start at:

0, 64, 128, 192

Example
IP: 192.168.1.70/26


Block size = 64

70 falls in 64–127

Network: 192.168.1.64

Broadcast: 192.168.1.127

Hosts: 65–126
