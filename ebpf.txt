ðŸ§  What Is eBPF?

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful Linux kernel technology that lets you run custom programs safely inside the kernel â€” without changing kernel code or loading kernel modules.

Itâ€™s like having a programmable hook inside the Linux kernel.



ðŸ§© The Idea in One Sentence

eBPF lets you attach small, sandboxed programs to events (like network packets, syscalls, or TCP retransmits), so you can observe, trace, or modify kernel behavior dynamically.






ðŸ”§ What Is bpftrace?

bpftrace is a high-level tracing tool built on top of eBPF.
Think of it as awk for the kernel â€” it lets you write one-liner scripts to watch whatâ€™s happening inside the kernel in real time.





| Feature  | eBPF                              | bpftrace                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Type     | Low-level kernel bytecode         | High-level scripting interface |
| Language | C / LLVM bytecode                 | Simple DSL like awk            |
| Use Case | Performance, networking, security | Tracing, debugging             |
| Example  | attach to TCP function            | print TCP events easily        |
