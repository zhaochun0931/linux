ðŸ§  What Is eBPF?

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful Linux kernel technology that lets you run custom programs safely inside the kernel â€” without changing kernel code or loading kernel modules.

Itâ€™s like having a programmable hook inside the Linux kernel.



ðŸ§© The Idea in One Sentence

eBPF lets you attach small, sandboxed programs to events (like network packets, syscalls, or TCP retransmits), so you can observe, trace, or modify kernel behavior dynamically.
