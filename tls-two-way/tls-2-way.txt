Here are the steps required for a 2 way SSL handshake process:

First, the client sends supported cipher suites and compatible SSL/TLS version to initiate the connection. This is called the “client hello” message.

In return, the web server checks the cipher suites and SSL/TLS version. Then, it sends its public certificate to the client along with a request for the client’s certificate and its “server hello” message.

Upon receiving the certificate file, the browser validates it. Afterward, the client sends its own SSL certificate to the server.

The server then verifies the client’s SSL/TLS certificate and paves the way for a secure connection with it.
