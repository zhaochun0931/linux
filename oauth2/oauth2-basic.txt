Clients are entities that can request authentication of a user. Clients come in two forms. 
The first type of client is an application that wants to participate in single-sign-on. These clients just want Keycloak to provide security for them. 
The other type of client is one that is requesting an access token so that it can invoke other services on behalf of the authenticated user.


OpenID Connect is the preferred protocol to secure applications.
