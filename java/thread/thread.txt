✅ 1. Classic Model: One Thread Per Connection (new thread per client)






✅ 2. Thread Pool Model (reuses threads, does not create new for each)






✅ 3. NIO / Netty Model (non-blocking, event-loop, usually single thread)




Every Java application has at least one thread: the main thread (which runs the main() method). 
To do more at once, you create additional threads. These threads share the same memory space (the Heap), but each has its own private Stack.
