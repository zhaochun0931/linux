While both jstack and jcmd are essential tools in a Java developer’s kit for diagnosing performance issues or deadlocks, they represent different eras of Java management.

Think of jstack as a specialized screwdriver and jcmd as a Swiss Army knife that happens to include a better screwdriver.

1. jstack: The Legacy Specialist
jstack is a JDK utility specifically designed to print Java stack traces of threads for a given Java process.

Primary Function: Thread dumps only.

Mechanism: It traditionally used the "Serviceability Agent" or attached to the target process to pull thread information.

Current Status: As of recent JDK versions (9+), jstack is actually considered a legacy tool. In fact, if you run it, the JDK often suggests using jcmd instead.





2. jcmd: The Modern Swiss Army Knife
Introduced in JDK 7, jcmd is the recommended, all-in-one replacement for several older tools (jstack, jmap, jinfo).

Primary Function: Multi-purpose. It can handle thread dumps, heap dumps, garbage collection stats, uptime, and more.

Mechanism: It sends diagnostic commands to the JVM via the Attach API. Because it is built into the modern JVM architecture, it is generally more performant and reliable.

The Command: To get a thread dump, you use: jcmd <pid> Thread.print
