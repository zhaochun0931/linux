hosts:      files dns myhostname



In this context, the line hosts: files dns myhostname specifies the order in which the system will attempt to resolve hostnames:

First, it will look at local files, like /etc/hosts.
Next, it will query DNS servers.
Finally, it will use the machineâ€™s hostname.




Well, you could on a small internal network that you controlled and which did not have very
many IP addresses. But, the hosts(/etc/hosts) file is not a manageable solution on a large network,
as it is an impossible task to keep it up to date. You could not have control
over every IP address.

Most applications use the getaddrinfo() function of the glibc library to resolve DNS requests. By
default, glibc sends all DNS requests to the first DNS server specified in the /etc/resolv.conf file. If this
server does not reply, RHEL uses the next server in this file. NetworkManager enables you to influence
the order of DNS servers in etc/resolv.conf.



By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) sends all DNS requests to the first DNS server specified in
the /etc/resolv.conf file. If this server does not reply, RHEL uses the next server in this file.
