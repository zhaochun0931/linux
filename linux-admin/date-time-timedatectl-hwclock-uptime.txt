hardware clock and system clock


When a Linux server boots, the hardware clock, also referred to as real-time clock, is read.

This clock typically resides in the computer hardware.




System time is a time maintained by the operating system. Once the system has booted, the system clock is completely independent of the hardware clock.

On a Linux system, time is calculated as an offset of epoch time. Epoch time is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, in UTC.
