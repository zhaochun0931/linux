RPM, the RedHat Package Manager
Most packages are simply installed with the upgrade option, -U, whether the package is already installed or not.

rpm -Uvh /path/to/rpm-package(s)

The -v option generates more verbose output, and -h makes rpm print a progress bar




rpm -qf /usr/bin/nc













# deb, This package format is the default on Debian GNU/Linux, also in Ubuntu.
dpkg -S /usr/bin/cat



























# apt, The Advanced Package Tool is a management system for software packages
# 
# 
# get an index of the available packages
apt update
apt install xxx























# centos or redhat
Yellowdog's Updater Modified (yum) is another tool that recently became more popular
