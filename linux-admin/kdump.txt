yum install kexec-tools
rpm -q kexec-tools






In case of a system crash, you can use the Kernel crash dump mechanism called kdump that enables you
to save the content of the system’s memory for later analysis. The kdump mechanism relies on the
kexec system call, which can be used to boot a Linux kernel from the context of another kernel, bypass
BIOS, and preserve the contents of the first kernel’s memory that would otherwise be lost.

When kernel crash occurs, kdump uses kexec to boot into a second kernel (a capture kernel), which
resides in a reserved part of the system memory that is inaccessible to the first kernel. The second
kernel captures the contents of the crashed kernel’s memory (a crash dump) and saves it.
