CRLF: This is a common line terminator in Windows environments, represented by the characters \r (Carriage Return) and \n (Line Feed)

To convert a file with CRLF line terminators (Windows format) to Unix format (which uses LF line terminators), you need to replace the CRLF pairs (\r\n) with just LF (\n).
