The proc file system contains many files that provide information about the
current performance state of a Linux server.

Every process that runs on Linux has a unique PID, and each of these processes builds its own environment





/proc

/proc/sys




To change a parameter, there are two methods:
Use echo to write the new parameter to the kernel tunable file.
Use sysctl -w to write the parameter to the kernel tunable.





systemctl status systemd-sysctl.service

During boot, the systemd-sysctl service is started. This service reads the sysctl configuration.


/etc/sysctl.conf is the default configuration file. On RHEL 7, this file should be used no longer.

sysctl settings are defined through files in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/







To get an idea of all available tunables, you can use the sysctl -a command. This command lists all available tunables.
