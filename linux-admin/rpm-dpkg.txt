RPM, the RedHat Package Manager


Most packages are simply installed with the upgrade option, -U, whether the package is already installed or not.

rpm -Uvh /path/to/rpm-package(s)

The -v option generates more verbose output, and -h makes rpm print a progress bar




rpm -qf /usr/bin/nc



dpkg -S /usr/bin/cat
