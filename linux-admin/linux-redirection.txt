STDIN refers to the standard input stream; usually, input from the keyboard. STDIN has a filehandle of 0 (zero)
The < operator is used to pass input from a file or I/O device data to a command.


<
<<

# Take standard input from filex
< filex





# cat << done > xx
> hello
> world
> done
#

# cat xx
hello
world
#
















STDOUT, the standard output stream. All output from this stream is typically sent to our terminal window. The filehandle for STDOUT is 1

The > operator is used to direct output from a command to a source; usually a file. By default, a single > will:

Create a new file if it doesnâ€™t already exist
Overwrite any pre-existing data in the file if the file already exists


While > overwrites data, the >> operator preserves data by appending to an existing file


# Write standard output to filex
> filex

# Append standard output to filex
>> filex
















STDERR, 2

2> 
2>>

# Write standard error stream to fileX
2> fileX




With the | (pipe) operator, we can chain many commands together by passing the output from one through as input to the next.



The >& operator is a special operator that is used for directing output from one stream to another. We can use it to pipe the output of STDERR to STDOUT:
