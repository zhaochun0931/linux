STDIN refers to the standard input stream; usually, input from the keyboard. STDIN has a filehandle of 0 (zero)

The < operator is used to pass input from a file or I/O device data to a command.


<
<<


# cat << done > xx
> hello
> 1
> done
#

# cat xx
hello
1

STDOUT, the standard output stream. All output from this stream is typically sent to our terminal window. The filehandle for STDOUT is 1

The > operator is used to direct output from a command to a source; usually a file. By default, a single > will:

Create a new file if it doesnâ€™t already exist
Overwrite any pre-existing data in the file if the file already exists


While > overwrites data, the >> operator preserves data by appending to an existing file





stderr
2 
2> 
2>>




With the | (pipe) operator, we can chain many commands together by passing the output from one through as input to the next.



The >& operator is a special operator that is used for directing output from one stream to another. We can use it to pipe the output of STDERR to STDOUT:
