🧩 What is Kerberos?

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol based on secret-key cryptography.
It was designed by MIT and is widely used in:

Enterprise environments (Active Directory)

Hadoop / Kafka / PostgreSQL clusters

Secure Linux SSO environments




🧠 Concept

Kerberos relies on a trusted third-party — the Key Distribution Center (KDC) — which issues tickets proving a user’s identity.




⚙️ Simplified Flow

User → KDC (AS-REQ): “Hi, I’m alice.”

KDC → User (AS-REP): “Here’s a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).”

User → KDC (TGS-REQ): “I’d like to access service X using my TGT.”

KDC → User (TGS-REP): “Here’s a service ticket for X.”

User → Service: Presents the ticket, service trusts it.


Everything is encrypted — passwords never go over the wire.
