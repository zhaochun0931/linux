firewalld is a firewall service daemon that provides a dynamic customizable host-based firewall with a D-Bus interface.


firewalld uses the concepts of zones and services, that simplify the traffic management. 

firewalld blocks all traffic on ports that are not explicitly set as open.






The predefined zones are stored in the /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ directory and can be instantly applied to any available network interface. These files are copied to the /etc/firewalld/zones/ directory only after they are modified. 





On installation, the default zone in firewalld is set to be the public zone. The default zone can be changed.











# how to check and configure the firewalld

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent
