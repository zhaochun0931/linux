firewalld is a firewall service daemon that provides a dynamic customizable host-based firewall with a D-Bus interface.


firewalld uses the concepts of zones and services, that simplify the traffic management. 

firewalld blocks all traffic on ports that are not explicitly set as open.




zone:
The predefined zones are stored in the /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ directory and can be instantly applied to any available network interface. These files are copied to the /etc/firewalld/zones/ directory only after they are modified. 


On installation, the default zone in firewalld is set to be the public zone. The default zone can be changed.





service:
Alternatively, you can edit the XML files in the /etc/firewalld/services/ directory. If a service is not added or changed by the user, then no corresponding XML file is found in /etc/firewalld/services/. 
The files in the /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ directory can be used as templates if you want to add or change a
service.


















# how to check and configure the firewalld 



systemctl status firewalld.service
systemctl stop firewalld.service
firewall-cmd --state






firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones






firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --list-services


firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=5432/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --check-config





firewall-cmd --query-port=5432/tcp

firewall-cmd --reload







# very dangerous
# Enabling panic mode stops all networking traffic. For this reason, it should be used only when you have the physical access to the machine or if you are logged in using a serial console.

firewall-cmd --panic-on
firewall-cmd --panic-off
firewall-cmd --query-panic
