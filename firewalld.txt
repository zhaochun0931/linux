firewalld is a firewall service daemon that provides a dynamic customizable host-based firewall with a D-Bus interface.

services





firewalld uses the concepts of zones and services, that simplify the traffic management.  firewalld blocks all traffic on ports that are not explicitly set as open.
The firewalld service is incompatible with the iptables service




Ports are logical devices that enable an operating system to receive and distinguish network traffic and
forward it accordingly to system services. These are usually represented by a daemon that listens on the
port, that is it waits for any traffic coming to this port.





/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts



ACCEPT: Accepts all incoming packets except those disallowed by specific rules.
REJECT: Rejects all incoming packets except those allowed by specific rules. When firewalld rejects packets, the source machine is informed about the rejection.
DROP: Drops all incoming packets except those allowed by specific rules. When firewalld drops packets, the source machine is not informed about the packet drop.








zone:
The predefined zones are stored in the /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ directory and can be instantly applied to any available network interface. These files are copied to the /etc/firewalld/zones/ directory only after they are modified. 


On installation, the default zone in firewalld is set to be the public zone. The default zone can be changed.





service:
Alternatively, you can edit the XML files in the /etc/firewalld/services/ directory. If a service is not added or changed by the user, then no corresponding XML file is found in /etc/firewalld/services/. 
The files in the /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ directory can be used as templates if you want to add or change a
service.









NAT(network address translation) type:
Masquerading
Source NAT (SNAT)
Destination NAT (DNAT)
Redirect



1. Masquerading and source NAT (SNAT)
Use one of these NAT types to change the source IP address of packets.


For example, Internet Service Providers do not route private IP ranges, such as 10.0.0.0/8. If you use private IP ranges in
your network and users should be able to reach servers on the Internet, map the source IP address of
packets from these ranges to a public IP address.


Masquerading and SNAT are very similar to one another. The differences are:
Masquerading automatically uses the IP address of the outgoing interface. Therefore, use masquerading if the outgoing interface uses a dynamic IP address.
SNAT sets the source IP address of packets to a specified IP and does not dynamically look up the IP of the outgoing interface. Therefore, SNAT is faster than masquerading. Use SNAT if the outgoing interface uses a fixed IP address.


















# firewalld is configured with the firewall-cmd command

systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl enable --now firewalld
systemctl status firewalld.service

firewall-cmd --state
firewall-cmd --reload







# zone
firewall-cmd --get-zones
firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones



# A zone can only be in an active state if it has one of these two conditions:
# The zone is assigned to a network interface
# The zone is assigned source IPs or network ranges



# service
firewall-cmd --list-all


# To see what services you currently have active on your firewall
firewall-cmd --list-services

# To see a list of all available service services that you could potentially add to your firewall
firewall-cmd --get-services




# ports
firewall-cmd --list-ports
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=5432/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --check-config


# By default, all changes to firewalld's configuration are temporary



firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent



firewall-cmd --query-port=5432/tcp








# very dangerous
# Enabling panic mode stops all networking traffic. For this reason, it should be used only when you have the physical access to the machine or if you are logged in using a serial console.

firewall-cmd --panic-on
firewall-cmd --panic-off
firewall-cmd --query-panic
