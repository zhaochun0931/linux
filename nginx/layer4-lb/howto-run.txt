NGINX supports Layer 4 (L4) load balancing for both TCP and UDP traffic.   

While NGINX is most famous for Layer 7 (HTTP) features, it handles Layer 4 via the stream module. 
This allows it to load balance traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers without decrypting or inspecting the actual content of the packets




How it Works
Unlike HTTP load balancing which uses the http {} block, L4 load balancing uses a separate stream {} block in your nginx.conf.
