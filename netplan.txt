Netplan is a utility for configuring network settings in modern versions of Ubuntu.


Netplan uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) files for configuration. These files typically reside in the /etc/netplan/ directory.



Backend Choices: Netplan supports two backend renderers:

Networkd: The default backend for server installations, uses systemd-networkd to apply network configurations.

Networkd (systemd-networkd):
systemd-networkd is a system service that is part of the systemd system and service manager. It is a lightweight, low-level network manager that provides network configuration and management for systems. It is designed for server environments where network configurations are typically static and need to be configured at boot.


Networkd is configured through files in /etc/systemd/network/ (for example, eth0.network), or if using Netplan, via YAML files in /etc/netplan/.





NetworkManager: Typically used on desktop environments and manages network configurations for user-oriented setups.


NetworkManager is a more feature-rich, user-oriented tool for managing network connections, primarily in desktop environments. It allows for dynamic network configurations, supports mobile networks, VPNs, Wi-Fi, and has both command-line and graphical user interface tools.


NetworkManager is configured through various GUI tools like nm-connection-editor or through configuration files in /etc/NetworkManager/

Example of a static IP configuration using nmcli

















/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
