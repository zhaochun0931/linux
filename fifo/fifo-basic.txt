Both pipes and FIFOs (named pipes) allow one-way data streaming between processes using a kernel buffer.




mkfifo mypipe


prw-r--r--  1 root root     0 Nov 16 12:29 mypipe


Terminal 1 (writer):

echo "hello fifo" > mypipe



Terminal 2 (reader):

cat mypipe









PIPE (Anonymous)

[ Parent Process ]
        |
    pipe()
        |
[ Child Process ]

Only these two can use it.










FIFO (Named Pipe)

       filesystem
     /             \
 writer          reader
  |                 |
echo > myfifo   cat myfifo



Any process can attach.
