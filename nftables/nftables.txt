nftables


NFTables (or nf_tables) is the modern packet filtering framework in the Linux kernel. It is the successor to the older iptables system and provides a more flexible, efficient, and unified way to manage firewalls, network address translation (NAT), and other packet manipulation tasks. 


Key concepts
Packet filtering framework: A tool that inspects network packets traveling through the Linux kernel and applies rules to them. It can accept, drop, or modify packets based on specific criteria.
Successor to iptables: Nftables was developed to overcome the limitations of the older iptables, ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables utilities by consolidating their functions into a single system.
nft utility: Users interact with the nftables framework via the nft command-line tool, which has a more consistent and readable syntax than the separate utilities it replaced. 







The nftables framework classifies packets and it is the successor to the iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables, and ipset utilities.

nft --version



# add table
nft add table ip table-name
nft delete table table-name


# add chain
nft add chain ip table-name chain-name '{ type filter hook input priority 0; }'
nft delete chain table-name chain-name


'ip' specifies that the table is for IPv4.
'type filter' specifies that this chain will filter packets.
'hook input' specifies that this chain will process incoming packets.
'priority 0' defines the priority of the hook.









# add rule
nft add rule ip table-name chain-name tcp dport 22 accept
nft delete rule ip table-name chain-name handle 1


# list rule
nft -a list ruleset


# save 
nft list ruleset > /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf
