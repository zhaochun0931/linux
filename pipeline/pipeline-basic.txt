A pipeline connects the output of one program to the input of another program using the | operator.



In Linux, everything that a program prints goes to file descriptor 1 (stdout).

A pipeline redirects that stdout into the stdin (file descriptor 0) of the next program.






🧩 Under the hood — how pipelines actually work

When you run:

cmd1 | cmd2


The shell does this internally:

1. Create a pipe → this gives 2 file descriptors:

fd[0] = read end

fd[1] = write end



2. fork() child for cmd1

duplicate fd[1] to stdout (fd 1)

close unused ends

exec() cmd1



3. fork() child for cmd2

duplicate fd[0] to stdin (fd 0)

close unused ends

exec() cmd2



4. Shell closes both ends and waits for both processes.
