In Linux, dd is a low-level data copy and conversion tool. Its name comes from “data definition” (sometimes jokingly called “disk destroyer” 😅 because it’s powerful and unforgiving).

It works by copying data byte-by-byte (or block-by-block) from an input to an output.




dd if=<input> of=<output> [options]
if → input file (or device)

of → output file (or device)

options → block size, count, conversions, etc.






dd if=/dev/zero of=largefile bs=1M count=5120


if=/dev/zero: This specifies the input file, which in this case is /dev/zero, a special file that provides null bytes (zeroes).

of=largefile: This specifies the output file. You can change largefile to the desired filename.

bs=1M: This sets the block size to 1MB.

count=5120: This specifies the number of blocks to copy. Since each block is 1MB, count=5120 will result in a 5GB file (5120 MB).



dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1M count=1024

Creates a 1 GB file filled with zeros.
