dd if=/dev/zero of=largefile bs=1M count=5120


if=/dev/zero: This specifies the input file, which in this case is /dev/zero, a special file that provides null bytes (zeroes).

of=largefile: This specifies the output file. You can change largefile to the desired filename.

bs=1M: This sets the block size to 1MB.

count=5120: This specifies the number of blocks to copy. Since each block is 1MB, count=5120 will result in a 5GB file (5120 MB).
