An Azure virtual network gateway provides secure connectivity between an Azure virtual network and other networks, either an on-premises network or another virtual network in Azure.

Azure provides two types of virtual network gateways:

Azure ExpressRoute gateways use private connections that don't traverse the public internet.

Azure virtual private network (VPN) gateways use encrypted tunnels over the internet.
